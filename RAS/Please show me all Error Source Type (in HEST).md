The **Error Source Type** field in the ACPI **Hardware Error Source Table (HEST)** defines the type of hardware error being reported. Each **Error Source Type** corresponds to a specific category of hardware component that can generate errors. Here is a list of all **Error Source Types** as per the **ACPI specification**:

### **List of Error Source Types**:

1. **0x00 - IA32/X64 Machine Check Exception (MCE)**:
    
    - Represents machine check exceptions that are generated by IA32/X64 processors. These are typically hardware errors detected by the processor.
2. **0x01 - IA32/X64 Corrected Machine Check (CMC)**:
    
    - Used for corrected machine check errors detected by the processor, typically non-fatal errors corrected by hardware.
3. **0x02 - IA32/X64 Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI)**:
    
    - NMI is used to report critical system errors that cannot be masked or ignored. These often indicate severe system issues.
4. **0x03 - IPF Machine Check Exception (MCE)**:
    
    - Used for machine check exceptions generated by Itanium processors (Intel Itanium Processor Family - IPF).
5. **0x04 - IPF Corrected Machine Check (CMC)**:
    
    - Represents corrected machine check errors detected by Itanium processors.
6. **0x05 - IPF Non-Maskable Interrupt (NMI)**:
    
    - NMI errors for Itanium processors.
7. **0x06 - PCI Express Root Port AER (Advanced Error Reporting)**:
    
    - Refers to errors detected and reported by the PCI Express (PCIe) Root Port through the AER mechanism.
8. **0x07 - PCI Express Device AER**:
    
    - Used for PCIe devices that implement AER (Advanced Error Reporting). This includes endpoint devices, switches, and other PCIe components.
9. **0x08 - PCI Express Bridge AER**:
    
    - Represents AER errors generated by PCIe bridges, which connect two PCIe domains or segments.
10. **0x09 - Generic Hardware Error Source (GHES)**:
    
    - A catch-all error source type for non-processor or non-PCIe related hardware components. This is used for various device errors that don't fit into the specific categories above.
11. **0x0A - Generic Hardware Error Source Version 2 (GHESv2)**:
    
    - An extended version of **GHES** that allows more detailed error reporting, often used for newer hardware or platform-level errors.
12. **0x0B - IA32/X64 SMI (System Management Interrupt)**:
    
    - Represents errors that are reported using System Management Interrupts (SMIs) on IA32/X64 platforms. These are often used for critical system events that need to be handled by firmware.
13. **0x0C - IPF SMI (System Management Interrupt)**:
    
    - SMI errors for Itanium platforms.
14. **0x0D - ARM Processor Error**:
    
    - Error source for ARM processors, typically related to machine check exceptions or similar critical hardware issues on ARM-based systems.
15. **0x0E - Firmware-First Error Source**:
    
    - Indicates that firmware, rather than the OS, is responsible for handling errors. This is often used in environments where the system firmware (e.g., UEFI) manages error detection and reporting before passing control to the operating system.
16. **0x0F - Reserved for future use**.

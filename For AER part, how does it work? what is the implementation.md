**Advanced Error Reporting (AER)** is a key feature of the **PCIe (Peripheral Component Interconnect Express)** specification that provides a standardized way to detect, log, and report errors that occur on the PCIe bus and devices. AER plays a critical role in improving system **Reliability, Availability, and Serviceability (RAS)** by allowing systems to detect errors in a granular way, attempt recovery, or report the issue for corrective action. Here's a detailed look at how **AER works** and its implementation:

### 1. **How AER Works**:

AER is responsible for detecting and reporting three main types of errors in PCIe systems:

- **Correctable Errors**: Errors that can be automatically corrected by the hardware without affecting system behavior.
- **Uncorrectable Non-Fatal Errors**: Errors that cannot be corrected but do not immediately cause the system to fail or crash.
- **Uncorrectable Fatal Errors**: Errors that are severe enough to potentially cause the system to crash or require a reset.

#### AER Workflow:

1. **Error Detection**:
    
    - PCIe devices and bridges are constantly monitoring their operation for potential errors. These could involve issues such as corrupted data transmissions, timeouts, memory errors, or invalid transactions.
    - When an error is detected, it is categorized into one of the three types: **Correctable**, **Uncorrectable (Non-Fatal)**, or **Uncorrectable (Fatal)**.
2. **Error Logging**:
    
    - Once an error is detected, AER allows the system to log detailed information about the error. This includes:
        - **Error source**: Which device or link experienced the error.
        - **Error type**: Whether it was correctable, non-fatal, or fatal.
        - **Status**: Information about the specific PCIe register state and error details.
    - Correctable errors are typically logged without triggering any further action.
    - Uncorrectable errors are logged in the AER registers in the device, and often trigger notifications to the operating system or hypervisor.
3. **Error Reporting**:
    
    - PCIe devices can report the error in two ways:
        - **In-band Error Reporting**: The error is reported via **PCIe Configuration Space** registers, specifically in the **AER capability structure**.
        - **Out-of-band Error Reporting**: The device sends an **Interrupt (MSI/MSI-X)** to alert the system that an error occurred.
    - The system software (typically the OS or hypervisor) reads the AER logs and takes the appropriate actions, such as logging the error, attempting recovery, or notifying the system administrator.
4. **Error Handling**:
    
    - **Correctable Errors**: Handled silently. They are logged, but the system usually continues operating normally.
    - **Uncorrectable Non-Fatal Errors**: These errors are logged, and the system software (like the OS) may attempt to isolate the faulty device or reset the device without crashing the whole system.
    - **Uncorrectable Fatal Errors**: These may require more drastic action. The system may attempt to recover by resetting the PCIe link or device, and in some cases, a full system reboot or shutdown may be required if recovery is not possible.
5. **Error Recovery**:
    
    - For **correctable errors**, the PCIe device itself corrects the issue (e.g., through retransmission or error-correcting code), and no further action is needed.
    - For **non-fatal errors**, the system may attempt to reset the PCIe device or driver, isolating the faulty device from the rest of the system without causing a system-wide crash.
    - For **fatal errors**, the system software typically initiates a more aggressive recovery, which might include resetting the PCIe bus or system reboot.

### 2. **AER Implementation**:

The implementation of AER involves several components in the system, including the **PCIe device**, the **PCIe bus**, and the **operating system**.

#### A. **AER Capability Structure**:

PCIe devices and bridges that support AER include an **AER capability structure** in their **PCIe configuration space**. This structure contains several registers used to log and report errors:

- **Uncorrectable Error Status Register**: Stores information about uncorrectable errors.
- **Correctable Error Status Register**: Stores information about correctable errors.
- **Uncorrectable Error Mask Register**: Allows the system to mask (ignore) certain uncorrectable errors.
- **Correctable Error Mask Register**: Allows masking of certain correctable errors.
- **Error Severity Register**: Indicates whether an uncorrectable error is considered fatal or non-fatal.
- **Error Header Log Registers**: Stores the header of the transaction that caused the error for diagnostic purposes.

#### B. **AER on the PCIe Bus**:

- AER works across the entire PCIe hierarchy, including both the PCIe root complex (which connects to the CPU and memory) and any PCIe bridges (which connect multiple devices).
- If a PCIe bridge detects an error on one of its downstream devices, it will propagate the error report upwards to the root complex.
- The PCIe bus supports **error forwarding**, which ensures that errors are propagated to the correct system software component for handling.

#### C. **Operating System and Driver Support**:

- The **operating system (OS)** or **hypervisor** plays a key role in handling AER. It interacts with the PCIe subsystem to log errors, notify administrators, and attempt recovery.
- **Error Recovery in the OS**: The OS may attempt to isolate the faulty PCIe device and disable or reset it, especially in the case of non-fatal errors. This prevents the error from escalating to a system-wide crash.
- **Driver Support**: Device drivers must be aware of AER and capable of responding to error reports. For example, if a GPU or network card reports an error via AER, its driver may reset the device or reinitialize it.
- **System Logs**: The OS also logs detailed information about the error in system logs (e.g., `dmesg` or `/var/log/messages` on Linux systems), which helps administrators identify and diagnose hardware problems.

#### D. **MSI and MSI-X for Error Notifications**:

- **Message Signaled Interrupts (MSI) or MSI-X**: PCIe devices use these to generate interrupts when they detect errors. The interrupt signals the OS to check the AER logs and handle the error.
- This mechanism allows the system to respond quickly to errors without polling the device, improving system performance and responsiveness.

### 3. **Error Classes in AER**:

AER defines the following classes of errors:

- **Correctable Errors**:
    - Data link layer errors (e.g., corrupted data transmission).
    - Receiver overflow (e.g., too much data sent at once).
- **Uncorrectable Non-Fatal Errors**:
    - Malformed TLP (Transaction Layer Packet).
    - Unsupported requests (e.g., the device receives a request it does not support).
- **Uncorrectable Fatal Errors**:
    - Poisoned TLP (corrupt data in the packet that cannot be processed).
    - Unexpected completion (e.g., receiving a response for a request the device didn’t make).

### 4. **Common PCIe AER Use Cases**:

- **Data Centers and Servers**: In large-scale server environments, AER allows for continuous monitoring of PCIe devices (e.g., network cards, RAID controllers) and immediate detection of issues without shutting down the system.
- **High-Performance Computing (HPC)**: In HPC systems, AER ensures that critical PCIe devices like GPUs and storage controllers maintain high reliability.
- **Virtualization**: In virtualized environments with **SR-IOV** (Single Root I/O Virtualization), AER ensures that errors in one virtual machine’s use of a PCIe device (e.g., NIC) do not affect other VMs.

### Conclusion:

**AER** is an essential part of the **PCIe specification**, designed to improve the reliability and availability of PCIe devices by detecting, logging, reporting, and recovering from errors. Its implementation involves error registers in the PCIe device, driver support in the operating system, and error handling mechanisms like MSI interrupts and logging. With these features, AER ensures that systems can continue to function, even in the presence of correctable or non-fatal errors, and helps administrators diagnose and repair more serious issues.

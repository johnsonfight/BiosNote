please give me UEFI edk2 open source code implementation of below example, 1. How to add a BIOS setting (e.g. boot order) option into PCR1? 2. If the value is changed, how to update PCR1 or any related things value?

To integrate a BIOS setting (such as the boot order) into **PCR1** in the UEFI EDK2 environment and ensure that the PCR is updated when the value is changed, you will need to follow these steps:

### 1. **Modify the BIOS Setting and Extend PCR1**

In UEFI, PCRs are extended using cryptographic hashes (like SHA-256), which means any change to a BIOS setting (such as the boot order) needs to be measured and extended into PCR1. Hereâ€™s how to implement it:

### **Step-by-Step Implementation:**

#### **Step 1: Measure the BIOS Setting (Boot Order)**

To measure the boot order, you can read the value of the boot order from the UEFI variables and compute its hash. In EDK2, UEFI variables are typically stored as `EFI_VARIABLE_NON_VOLATILE` or `EFI_VARIABLE_BOOTSERVICE_ACCESS`.

##### **Sample Code for Measuring Boot Order:**

This code demonstrates how to measure the boot order and extend it to **PCR1**.

#### **Explanation:**

- The UEFI `BootOrder` variable is retrieved using `GetVariable()`.
- A **SHA-256 hash** of the boot order is computed using `HashSha256()`.
- The hash is extended into **PCR1** using the `EFI_TCG2_PROTOCOL`'s `HashLogExtendEvent()` function.
- **`PCR1`** is specified as the target PCR for the extension.

#### **Step 2: Handle BIOS Setting Change (Boot Order Update)**

When the **Boot Order** changes, it must trigger a re-extension into **PCR1**. The UEFI boot manager or firmware settings typically handle BIOS settings changes, so you need to ensure that whenever the setting is modified, the PCR is extended.

To achieve this:

- Hook into the UEFI variable write process (e.g., use a UEFI driver that monitors variable writes).
- After the `BootOrder` variable is modified, you should call the `ExtendBootOrderToPcr1()` function to recompute the hash and re-extend **PCR1**.

#### **Sample Code for Monitoring BootOrder Changes:**

You can create a UEFI driver that hooks into the variable write process to detect when `BootOrder` is modified.

### **Step 3: Update the Boot Process to Include PCR1 Measurement**

In your UEFI boot sequence, ensure that **PCR1** is extended early in the boot process, ideally as part of the pre-boot measurements (before the operating system is loaded).
